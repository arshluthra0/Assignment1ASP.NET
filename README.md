2200- Just started off with my ASP.NET Assignment 1 project and we got some serious stuff going on here!!
All of this robust ASP.NET Core Web Application and the architecture it is built is really exiting and I cannot wait to get my hands on this.

2210- Read all the details of the project carefully and made sure I had understood each and every point mentioned.

2222- Started a new ASP.NET Core web App project and got it running, and it failed!!!

2234- Reviewed what I had learnt earlier about in my class with my awesome professor Andrew Steele. And I instanstly figured it out.

2240- Again started from scrach, created a  new ASP.NET Core Web Application in 5.0 MVC Framework.

This time what I did was while I was creating it I clicked on the check box saying 'configure for https'.
By doing this, my web application will be configured using https and is already much more secure than with the http.

2250- and I tried running it annnnddddd..............

Its a success!!!! I can see the web app that is displayed by default by the Microsoft.

Man I really am enjoying this high-tech enviornment.

Thanks Microsoft for this gift to humankind. :P

I think I am done for the day, will carry on tommorow.

1434- Lets roll!!!

Opened visual studio 2019 and bammm it opened with the message saying that my lisence to use VS 2019 has expired.

What is going on here???

I need to dig a little deep.

1440- Did some search on Google and foung that I had mistakenly downloaded the VS 2019 Enterprise version instead of the Community version which is free and purposely made for students like me.

Sorry human error.

1455- Finally I have uninstalled the Enterprise version and installed the Community version.

Opened my project and got down to the first and the most crucial step of all, linking all the data to Github.

Created a repository on Github and linked my project code to the repos.

Now whatever I will do will also be backed up in my github.

going for a break.

1630- Few just came back from the gym.
Now we will go to the next step, and I Added User Accounts authentication to the project.

Yayyy Now I have 2 admin accounts and 2 user accounts.

I gave the update, delete and add commands to the admin accounts.
This cannot be accessed through the user accounts.

Also added Role-based authentication to access the MVC webpage

1024- Today is a great day to start.
Just had some coffee and yess here we go...

Ran the project for some additional satisfaction.

Thinking about my project. What should it be about?

hmmm......



......hmmmm

Yess, I got it!
It should be about the one thing that i am crazy about.
Sunglasses!

I love collecting and wearing sunglasses because of which I have too many of them. I love summer and wearing sunglasses in the sun makes me feel very happy.
Sunglasses add a little style in our lifestyle.

So The company's name..

Flying sunglasses??

1634- By following each and every step carefully given on the Microsoft's website I was able to perform these vigours tasks. Handle to deny direct URL access without login 

--Added link to navigate product catalogue page and about us 

--Added CRUD for product catalog and available to access for admin 

--Added List view page for product catalog and available to access for users only.

1811- Then I added more than 10 product items when seeding the database .

To be honest seeding them was much more easier than I thought it would be. XP

Done for the day!

2204- While using the Entity framework core code first approach I succeded in making alot of changes 

--Migeration will help to create table and seed the data as well 

0133 For Adding Azure deployment I even had to enter my card details so that in the future Microsoft can cut the fees of azure membership.

P.s.- I really hope they don't charge me for fidling with small little things in azure. HAHAH

This was the part that ate up almost all of my time.
After a milenia of errors and debugging 
I had fulfilled the Requirement of Dependency to communicate with DB and enables commands for Migration:
 -- Entity framework core 
 -- Entity framework SQLite
 -- EntityFrameworkCore Tools

 Annndd Finally my ASP.NET 5.0 Core Web App is ready to be submited.

 I really hope you like my work. Hoping for a positive responce from your side, thanks.
